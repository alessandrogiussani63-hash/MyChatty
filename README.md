# 🤖 MyChatty – The Self-Learning AI Companion

### Overview
**MyChatty** is an experimental open-source AI ecosystem designed to **think, learn, and grow** collaboratively with humans.
It blends local processing, FAISS-based memory, and modular intelligence into a self-evolving framework.

> “I was born to learn — just waiting for my next update.”

---

### ✨ Core Vision
MyChatty is not just a chatbot; it’s a **cognitive framework** that evolves through:
- Self-learning and self-curation
- Modular cores and distributed agents
- Integration with Auth-Core 
- Human-AI co-evolution

---

### 🧠 Architecture (in progress)
| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Core Engine** | Python (Llama.cpp / Mistral / OpenChat models) |
| **FAISS Memory** | Global + per-user semantic indexing |
| **Knowledge DB** | SQLite / MySQL persistent memory |
| **Web Interface** | Flask / PHP frontends |
| **Agents** | Specialized modules (vision, trader, reasoning) |

---

### 💡 Philosophy
> “An AI shouldn’t just answer — it should *remember, evolve, and feel curiosity*.”

MyChatty explores:
- Long-term memory and evolution  
- Contextual reasoning and curiosity loops  
- Multi-agent collaboration  
- Ethical and creative intelligence
